# VgMovies
The ideia behind this project is to:

1 - Scrap ratings from video game movies from rotten tomatoes and store both user ratings and cricts ratings 


2 - Scrap ratings from the same video-games series (from metacritic) and make a avg game series rating to compare with both ratings from movies
  
  
 3- Cluster and plot a 3D Scatterplot using the ratings.
