# VgMovies
The ideia behind this project is to:

1 - Scrap ratings from video game movies from rotten tomatoes
  1.1 - Store both user ratings and cricts ratings 


2 - Scrap rating from the same video-games series (scraped from metacritic)
  2.1 - Make a avg game series rating to compare with both ratings from movies
  
  
 3- Cluster and plot a 3D Scatterplot with the ratings.
